This document provides set of guidelines for reviewing the proposals.

Role of Reviewers
-----------------

-  Reviewers are pillars for selecting quality talks. As a reviewer you
   will be interacting with proposers through [Junction instance of PyCon India](http://in.pycon.org/cfp/).
-  Reviewers will be judging the proposal purely based on content.
-  Reviewers should not give too much weightage to the past speaking experience
   of the speaker as PyCon India would like to encourage first time speakers.
   However, make sure the speaker is well qualified to give a talk on that topic.
-  Reviewers are recommended to provide feedback from the early stage of
   submission to help improve the quality of talks and ease the
   selection of final list of talks.
-  The final schedule of talks would be prepared by the organizing team.
   Reviewers are encouraged to provide suggestions based on the proposal
   content.

Expectations from Proposals
---------------------------

-  Proposal should mention clearly on the topics covered. If any
   proposal lack enough information, reviewers should comment on the
   proposal.
-  Proposers should give ample details about their work on the topic,
   for eg., blog posts or open source contributions if any.
-  If a proposal is too broad and 40 minutes is too less to cover,
   reviewers should give feedback about it.
-  Plagiarised proposals shouldn't be encouraged.
-  Repeated proposals from last year is discouraged. Exceptions are fine
   in case the coverage depth is more compared to last year.
-  Good to have : Single proposer per proposal is encouraged.

Mode of Communication
---------------------

-  Reviewers should use junction to communicate with proposers
   (instructions on how to use it will be shared soon) .
-  Using different mediums like Phone/Email/Skype aren't encouraged.
-  If proposers aren't communicating back after repeated follow ups,
   Reviewers team with organizing team will make a final call.
-  It would be good if reviewer can provide sample presentation template
   which proposer can use if they wish to.
-  Reviewers are expected to update status with organizing team so that
   the organizing team would be able to update the progress to public.

Criteria to Accept/Reject proposals
-----------------------------------

-  Talk without presentation shouldn't be selected under any
   circumstances.
-  Talk should only be selected based on content not on Employer
   request/popularity of the speaker.
-  Previous year's feedback on talks or speakers should be considered
   before selecting a talk.
-  Presentation shouldn't be using employer's template and also it
   should not advertise about the employer.
-  Feedback on why a proposal is accepted/rejected should be updated in
   junction.

Workshops
---------

-  Workshops are for 2 hours and 30 minutes. This requires hands on
   experience. Scope of the workshop and the take away from attending
   the workshop need to be carefully crafted.
-  It is highly recommended for proposers to upload the workshop
   content.
