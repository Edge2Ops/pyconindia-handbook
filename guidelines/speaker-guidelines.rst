Guidelines for a great talk
--------------

It is a joint responsibility of organisers, and speakers to make the presentations at Pycon India, 2016 the best that they can be. A great talk requires not only a firm grasp of the content that is being presented, but an ability to connect to the audience, and bring across the material in the talk


Basic courtesies:
--------------
The presentation should not be a marketing talk. Ideally, there should be no mention of technologies, programming platforms, products, or services that the speaker or their current employees are involved in. At best, they can be mentioned in passing, but the emphasis of the presentation should be the aspects related to Python.

No official marketing of the speaker of his own material, such as books/software CDs, etc., should be avoided at the venue. However it is acceptable if the speaker carries a few copies (<10) of his book/CD in order to give away to friends / acquaintances in an informal manner.
Employer logos should not be on every slide: an unobstrusive logo on the title slide is fine


All proceedings of the conference will be in the public domain, so do not share information that might be confidential in nature


Even if you think that you are an experienced public speaker, please take some time time to search the Internet, and read up on public speaking tips. One article that we particularly liked is http://hintjens.com/blog:107 . Briefly:
Do not just read off of the slides. The audience is perfectly capable of doing that, and will be bored.
Engage with the audience. Make eye contact with several people across the room. Rather than lecturing to the audience build a conversation.

Keep things simple: especially with technical talks, a natural urge is to go into too much detail.
Challenge the audience. For this, you have to first be confident in your understanding of the material that you are presenting. However, your audience might well have equally-experienced folk: seek to benefit from their insights
